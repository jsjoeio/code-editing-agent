# code-editing-agent

This is a small agent in TypeScript I built following this article from Thorsten Ball:

[How To Build An Agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent)

[anthropic-sdk docs](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript)

## Local Development 
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.10. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
